# School_District_Analysis
## Summary of Findings
During this project, we were tasked to analyze a dataset of information based on the characteristics and averages of different schools as well as better grade scales on subjects or better budgets. However, before starting this process we had to make sure everything is alright with the data.

Before doing the analysis of this dataset, we were able to clean the information of duplicates as well as errors which gave us the opportunity to study better and cleaner data. Once we had a better understanding of the data, we could identify that between the reading and math classes, the average grade which was higher was the reading one.

This means that between the different grades and school names, students got better grades in reading than in math.

Finally, an important fact that we could gather at the end of this analysis was that the average school budget, of public and private schools, was 911195.558251 and 872625.656236, respectively, meaning in this case public schools have more budget than private ones.
